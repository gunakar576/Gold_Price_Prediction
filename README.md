##  Gold_Price_Prediction
 # Overview
- This project focuses on predicting gold prices using historical financial data and machine learning techniques. Accurate gold price forecasting is useful for investors, analysts, and economists for better decision-making.

 **Objectives**
- Predict the price of gold using economic indicators.

- Understand the relationship between gold (GLD) and other financial metrics like SPX, USO, SLV, and EUR/USD.

- Compare different machine learning models to find the best-performing one.

**Dataset Description**
The dataset includes the following columns:

- Column	Description
- Date	Date of record
- SPX	S&P 500 Index value
- GLD	Gold ETF price (target variable)
- USO	Crude oil ETF price
- SLV	Silver ETF price
- EUR/USD	Euro to US Dollar exchange rate

**Technologies Used**
- Python

- Pandas, NumPy

- Matplotlib, Seaborn (for EDA & Visualization)

- Scikit-learn (for ML models)

- Jupyter Notebook
